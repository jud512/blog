            title: "NASA Successfully Crashes Test Spacecraft into Asteroid",
            desc: "NASA has successfully rammed a spacecraft into an asteroid, in a first test of technology that could protect Earth from potential planet-destroying asteroids. The aim of the test was to change the orbit of a 160-meter non-threatening asteroid called Dimorphos. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test — or Dart — spacecraft collided with Dimorphos about 11 million kilometers away, at a speed of 22,500 kilometers per hour — that's about 6 kilometers per second! The spacecraft destroyed itself in the process. Telescopes around the world and in space aimed at the same point in the sky to capture the spectacle. The impact was immediately obvious — Dart's radio signal abruptly ceased. Normally, losing signal from a spacecraft is a very bad thing. But in this case, it was the ideal outcome, said NASA program scientist Tom Statler.Launched in November 2021, the Dart navigated to its target using new technology developed by Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory, the spacecraft builder and mission manager. The $325 million mission was the first attempt to shift the position of an asteroid or any other natural object in space. As far as we can tell, our first planetary defense test was a success, Mission Control's Elena Adams told a news conference. It usually takes Dimorphos about 12 hours to orbit Didymos, a fast-spinning asteroid five times bigger that flung off the material that formed its junior partner. And although it could take a few months to determine how much the asteroid's course was changed, early calculations estimate the collision will cut the orbit time by about 10 minutes. This might not sound like much, scientists noted, but it would amount to a significant change over years. Planetary defense experts prefer pushing a threatening asteroid or comet out of the way, given enough lead time, rather than blowing it up and creating multiple pieces that could rain down on Earth. Multiple impactors might be needed for big space rocks or a combination of impactors and so-called gravity tractors, not-yet-invented devices that would use their own gravity to pull an asteroid into a safer orbit.",
